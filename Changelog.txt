1.0 (Jan 26 - 2016)
-First release

1.1 (May 31 - 2016)
Fixes/bugs
----------
-Domain decomposition warn the user if boundary buffer between two tasks is
too small for correct VT computation. Such cases can happen in extremely
anisotropic/clustered particle distributions, and user should increase
BORDERFACTOR to solve this.
-Warning if number of boundary particles is larger than the number of
particles. In this case BORDERFACTOR is too large or parallelization reach
granularity and number of tasks must be reduced.

New features
------------
-Code computes density gradient vectors over each particle using VT structure.

-New configuration parameter AUTOBORDER: increase the boundary thickness
automatically between two tasks, it start from BORDERFACTOR until the number 
of particles reach the average number of particles expected in the inital 
boundary layer. This may be useful for uneven particle distribution, but consumes
more time and in some cases may over-estimate the required boundary layer for 
correct VT computation.
